      <p>At TBC Real Estate, we act as an extension of the builder's team to handle marketing. We'll meet with each builder to determine goals, create a custom marketing plan, and provide market research on geographic areas. We review these plans quarterly to ensure your development's success. With nearly 20 years of experience building custom homes in Idaho, we reduce the disconnect between the construction and sales process.</p>
